# BigQuery Tests
This repository consists of a few files where I locally tried out Google's Big Query functions, they are quite straightforward so you can use them for learning purposes.
Don't forget to create a .env file with following variables:
```
PROJECT_ID
KEY_ROUTE
TEST_MODEL
TRADING_MODEL
```

## Datasets used
- _Analytics by Google_ (basic-queries-and-eval.py)
- _Cymbal Investments by_ Cymbal Group (trading.py)
